// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisOfRequirements = 'This is the second step, in which stakeholders will interact and document needed project requirements.'
const design = 'This is the third step, in which you will create the architecture of what you are looking to develop.'
const implementation = 'This is the fourth step, in which you start building the software via the agreed upon coding language.'
const testingAndIntegration = 'This is the fifth step, in which you will evaluate the qualify of the software and look for issues.'
